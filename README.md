# Nightmare
BYOR (Bring Your Own Renderer) physics engine.

## Compiling
We use CMake, all the dependencies are self contained so you shouldn't need anything besides OpenGL installed.

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -jX
$ ./build/nightmare
```

This has pre-configured CLion and VScode builds as well, just open the project in either and click the run button.
